    <h1>Mohammad Ali</h1>

        Mohammad Ali, also known as "The Greatest," was one of the most celebrated athletes of the 20th century. He was
        not only
        an incredible boxer, but also a civil rights activist and humanitarian. Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on
        January 17,
        1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, he began his boxing career at the age of 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ali's career quickly took off, and he went on to win a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the
            1960
            Summer
            Olympics in Rome. He turned professional later that year and soon became known for his flamboyant
            personality
            and his
            ability to predict the round in which he would knock out his opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1964, at the age of 22, Ali won the heavyweight championship of the world by defeating Sonny Liston.
            After
            the fight,
            he announced that he had converted to Islam and changed his name to Mohammad Ali. He also became known for
            his
            political
            activism, speaking out against the Vietnam War and refusing to be drafted into the military. As a result, he
            was
            stripped of his boxing titles and banned from the sport for several years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ali returned to the ring in 1970 and went on to have several more iconic fights, including the "Thrilla in
            Manila"
            against Joe Frazier in 1975. He retired from boxing in 1981 with a record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37
            knockouts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of the ring, Ali continued to be a prominent figure in the civil rights movement and worked
            tirelessly
            to
            promote peace and understanding between people of different races and religions. He was also a strong
            advocate
            for
            Parkinson's disease research, which he was diagnosed with in 1984.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout his life, Ali was known for his wit, charm, and charisma, as well as his incredible athleticism
            and
            boxing
            skills. He passed away on June 3, 2016, at the age of 74, but his legacy lives on as an inspiration to
            people
            all over
            the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, Mohammad Ali was a true icon of the 20th century, a gifted athlete, and a champion of human
            rights and
            social justice. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations to fight for what they believe in,
            and to
            always
            strive for greatness both in and out of the ring.
